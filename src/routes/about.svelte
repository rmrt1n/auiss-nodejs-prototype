<p>
  Asia Pacific University Indonesian Student Society is an international student society, formed
  back in 2005. Initially we were created by our seniors to provide Indonesians student a platform
  to celebrate our own Independence Day and obviously, to also strengthen fellow Indonesians in APU
  bonds. We proudly stand as one of the biggest and most active society in our campus with our
  varieties of event and activities.

  Not so similar with other common student societies out there, we decided to create and grow our
  community in family-like environment, thus encourage members growth not only in organizational
  aspect, but also in their own talent and interest. Currently we have 7 active clubs specializing
  in various types of sport and art.

  Aside from our weekly clubs' activities, we also have our own annually event for both internal and
  external. From charity to cultural show, we got them all. We envision to create event not only to
  entertain, but also educating and benefiting the societies in various way. And thatâ€™s how we able
  snatch the award of most active international community and the award of charity &amp community in
  2018.
